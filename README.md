# 🎓 Margdarshak: Career Guidance Portal

## 📘 Project Overview

**Margdarshak** is a web-based **Career Guidance Portal** designed to support students in exploring and choosing the right career paths based on their interests and skills. The platform provides essential information on various academic fields such as **Engineering (B.Tech)**, **Medical (MBBS)**, and career tracks like **Coding**, **Non-Coding**, and **Placement Preparation**.

The project includes interactive webpages, event-related documents, and a basic user interface to simulate login and registration functionality. It was developed to guide students with structured career information and practical resources.

The portal is designed using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and includes **PHP** for handling backend logic such as user authentication (login/registration) and form processing.
